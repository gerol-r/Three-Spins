## <a name="design"></a>Design
* By the time finished building out basic functionality, I knew I wanted a record spinning in the background of the landing page, so I figured out GSAP (at least for 360 rotation).
* I found cool robot avatars and extracted dark and light color palettes for my theme.
* I didn't know where to go with my layout and style until [google brought me here](https://dribbble.com/shots/25667779-Travel-Website-UIUX-Design)

## <a name="author"></a>About The Author
I build applications and mini projects tied to my various interests. I enjoy design the most, but am most intriqued by how and why things work. I'm learning software engineering, but want to dabble in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and eventually AI engineering.
